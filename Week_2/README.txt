Leap Year python script




Psudo-Code
    There wasn't much in the way of psudo-code here as the entire program was layed out with a
    flow chart. This chart can be seen within the project repo or on the documentation for the 
    assignment that was turned in on canvas.

    *Idea behind modulus  coding inspored by ourcodeworld.com "How to determine whether a
    year is a leap year or not in programming",  found at www.shorturl.at/pDJU1

Requirements
    Write the program itself, which gives us the result (whether a year is a
    leap year or not). Submit a .py file with the following format -
    firstname_lastname_hw1.py.

    Also, turn in a flow chart that has the program drawn out in a visual design.
