Simeon Patton
CS362 Homework 3
Leap Year python script
    with and without error handling


Psudo-Code
    There wasn't much in the way of psudo-code here as the entire program was layed out with a
    flow chart. This chart can be seen within the project repo or on the documentation for the 
    assignment that was turned in on canvas.

    Idea behind modulus coding inspired by ourcodeworld.com "How to determine whether a
    year is a leap year or not in programming",  found at www.shorturl.at/pDJU1

Requirements
    Copy the program from homework 1 and add error handling.
    Upload to GitHub
    Insert original flow chart into readme file and upload to GitHub.
