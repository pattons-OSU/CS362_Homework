Python UNITTEST module in action


Psudo-Code
    Once again, not much in the way of psudo-test here as the main programs
    were easy one or tw liners. I did have some ideas going into the assignment
    on how to write them as well as the test modules.

Requirements
        1. Write code to calculate the volume of a cube.
        2. Write code to calculate the average of elements in a list.
        3. Write code that generates a full name when you provide the first and
           last name as inputs.

        For each of these programs we needed to write 3 tests. A test consists
        of one passing test and one failing test.

        Upload all code to github and submit write-up on pdf in canvas.
